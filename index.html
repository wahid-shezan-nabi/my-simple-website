        <h3>Black panther</h3>
        <p>
            Wesley Snipes planned to make a Black Panther film in 1992, but the project did not come to fruition. In September 2005, <strong>Marvel</strong>Studios listed a Black Panther film as one of ten films based on Marvel characters intended to be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Mark Bailey was hired to write a script in January 2011. Black Panther was officially announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in Captain America: Civil War (2016). Cole and Coogler had joined by then, with additional casting in May. Black Panther was the first Marvel Studios film with a Black director and a predominantly Black cast.
